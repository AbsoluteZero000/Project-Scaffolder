  "description": "Swagger is a tool that helps you design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. The main goal of Swagger is to define a standard interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection."
